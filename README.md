I used a dataset that consist a collection of tweets with the hashtag #chatgpt : discussions about the chatgpt language model, sharing experiences with using chatgpt, or asking for help with chatgpt-related issues. The tweets could also include links to articles or websites related to chatgpt, as well as images, videos, or other media. Overall, a collection of tweets with the hashtag #chatgpt would provide a glimpse into the online conversation surrounding chatgpt.
